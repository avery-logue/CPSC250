Practice with reading and writing to files

## CarsForSale

Read list of cars from filepath.

See the JUnit tests that create the files to read.

## Array2D

Create a 2D array of strings that show "(row, col)" indices.
Write this to file and read from file with consistent format

These are the only two files you need to modify
