A simple HelloWorld example we will use to demonstrate Git and Eclipse in CPSC 250.

Students are required to demonstrate forking and cloning this project using Gitlab and Git.
Create a personal Gitlab group for this class.  
Add me as a reporter to your group.

Fork this project into your course group.

Clone repo to your computer, and point Eclipse to this repo for project.
Add JUnit library and add a ``src/`` folder to the project.
Add ``HelloWorld.java`` to the ``src/`` folder, and write the proper code.

Check against JUnit tests.

Add and commit the file to your local repo, and push to Gitlab.  Check the `pipeline` on gitlab.

Update the login.txt file with your VT WebCat login user ID and password, and push again to make sure your WebCat is working.

Check the submission on WebCat to be sure you received points.

Bring your personal laptop to my office (329 Luter Hall) and demonstrate all tools working.
Contact me if you do not have a laptop.

* 25 pts due WebCat by Monday 15-Jan by 11:59 PM
* 25 pts due my office by Tuesday 16-Jan by 5:00 PM (10 points per day late)
