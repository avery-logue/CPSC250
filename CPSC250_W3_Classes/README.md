Practice with 1D and 2D arrays.  Including arrays of objects.

## Eggstravaganza

The Egg.java class creates an instance with data about an Egg.  It has some print methods that
print the data using a ```toString``` method that belongs to a particular instance, and
static methods that print data for a given instance and an array of Eggs.

We will work with this in class, and need to make a few changes.

The Eggstravaganza.java class will be used to demonstrate issues with objects and arrays.
After exposing the issues, we will complete EggTest.java to test the Egg class, and then fix the
issues.


## FarmAnimals Test

We will work to define a collection of farm animals using inheritance
